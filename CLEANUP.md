# Cleanup Notes

This repository is being simplified around the ChatGLM3 GGUF workflow. The following legacy artifacts were removed:

- `g.py`: ad-hoc demo for a previous Demiurgic checkpoint that no longer exists in this branch.
- `humaneval_results/`: stored sample outputs unrelated to the current GGUF-based pipeline.

Additional pruning can follow once remaining training/evaluation assets are reviewed against the updated goals.
