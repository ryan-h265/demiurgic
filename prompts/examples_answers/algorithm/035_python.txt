def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    """Compute trapped rain water using two pointers."""
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max = right_max = water = 0

    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            if height[left] >= left_max:
                left_max = height[left]
            else:
                water += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            if height[right] >= right_max:
                right_max = height[right]
            else:
                water += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1
    return water
```
**Explanation:** Move two pointers inward, tracking the maximum bar seen from each side. The smaller side determines the water level there, because a taller bar exists on the opposite side. Accumulate water as the difference between the current side's max and its height.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
**Notes:**
- Returns 0 for arrays shorter than 3.
- Works with zero heights; assumes non-negative elevations.
- For very large sums, switch to `int` -> `float`? `int` in Python is unbounded.
