from typing import Optional


class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int, next: Optional["ListNode"] = None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


def has_cycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    """Detect a cycle using Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm."""
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:
            return True
    return False
```
**Explanation:** Advance two pointers at different speeds; if the fast pointer laps the slow pointer, a cycle exists. If the fast pointer reaches the end, the list terminates without a cycle.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> (points back to 2)
Output: True
**Notes:**
- Works for empty list (`head=None`) and single-node lists.
- To find the cycle start, reset one pointer to head after detection and step both one at a time.
- Avoids modifying the list or storing visited nodes.
