```python
import heapq
from typing import Iterable, List, Any


def kth_largest(nums: Iterable[int], k: int) -> int:
    """Return the kth largest element using a min-heap of size k."""
    min_heap: List[int] = []
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        # Keep only the k largest seen so far
        if len(min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    if len(min_heap) < k:
        raise ValueError("k is larger than the number of elements")
    return min_heap[0]
```
**Explanation:** Iterate through numbers while maintaining a min-heap of the k largest values seen. When the heap grows beyond k, pop the smallest so only the k largest remain. After processing all numbers, the root of the heap is the kth largest.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n log k); Space: O(k) for the heap.
**Example:**
Input: nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2
Output: 5
**Notes:**
- Raises ValueError when k exceeds the number of items.
- For streaming data, this approach still works since it processes items one-by-one.
- To get kth smallest, invert comparisons or use max-heap via negation.
