```python
from functools import reduce

# Using Python's reduce to sum the list
result = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, [1, 2, 3, 4], 0)
```
**Explanation:** `reduce` applies the lambda cumulatively from left to right. Starting at 0, it adds each element: (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4, resulting in 10. The arrow syntax shown in the prompt is JavaScript-style, but the behavior is equivalent to the Python example above.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1) auxiliary.
**Example:**
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10
**Notes:**
- Always supply an initial value when the list might be empty to avoid `TypeError`.
- For readability, `sum([1, 2, 3, 4])` is preferred when simply adding numbers.
- The lambda can be replaced with any associative operation (product, max, merging dicts, etc.).
