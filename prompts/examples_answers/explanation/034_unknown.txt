Binary search repeatedly halves the search space in a sorted array by comparing the target to the middle element and discarding one half each step.
```
**Explanation:** Each comparison discards half of the remaining elements, so the number of iterations grows with the logarithm of the input size. It requires the data to be sorted to safely skip halves.
**Complexity:** Time: O(log n); Space: O(1) for iterative implementation (O(log n) if implemented recursively due to call stack).
**Example:**
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 7
Output: index 3
**Notes:**
- Sorting upfront costs O(n log n) if the array is unsorted.
- Recursive forms add call-stack overhead; iterative keeps constant space.
- Not suitable for unsorted data without preprocessing.
