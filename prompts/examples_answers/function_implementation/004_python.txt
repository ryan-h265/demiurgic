```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """Check if a string reads the same forward and backward."""
    cleaned = ''.join(ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum())
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
```
**Explanation:** Normalize the string by lowercasing and removing non-alphanumeric characters, then compare it to its reverse slice. Equality indicates a palindrome.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(n) for the cleaned copy.
**Example:**
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: True
**Notes:**
- Remove the cleaning step if punctuation and case should be considered.
- Handles empty strings (treated as palindrome).
- For very long strings, compare characters from both ends to reduce temporary allocations.
