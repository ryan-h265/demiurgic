```java
public class Factorial {
    // Fix: handle n <= 1 as base case and guard against negatives
    public static long factorial(int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be non-negative");
        }
        long result = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** The buggy version recursed without a base case for n == 0 and used Python syntax. Here we provide a Java implementation that iterates from 2 to n, multiplying into a running product. It treats 0! and 1! as 1 and rejects negative inputs.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: n = 5
Output: 120
**Notes:**
- Returns 1 for n = 0 or n = 1 per factorial definition.
- Uses `long`; for larger n, switch to `BigInteger` to avoid overflow.
- Iterative form avoids recursion depth concerns.
