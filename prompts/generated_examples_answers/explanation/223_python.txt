python
```python
from functools import reduce
result = reduce((lambda acc, x: acc + x), [1, 2, 3, 4], 0)
```
**Explanation:** `reduce` starts with accumulator `0` and applies `acc + x` for each list element, producing a running sum: (((0+1)+2)+3)+4 = 10. The final value is assigned to `result`.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1) auxiliary.
**Example:**
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10
**Notes:**
- Without an initial value, the first list element would become the initial accumulator.
- For summing numbers, `sum([1,2,3,4])` is clearer, but `reduce` generalizes to other fold operations.
- On empty lists, always provide an initial value to avoid `TypeError`.
