javascript
```javascript
list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))))
```
**Explanation:** Filters numbers 0..9 to keep evens, then maps each to its square, collecting the results. In JavaScript the equivalent is `Array.from({length:10}, (_,i)=>i).filter(x => x % 2 === 0).map(x => x * x)`.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(n) for the output list.
**Example:**
Input: 0..9
Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
**Notes:**
- Order of operations matters: filtering first avoids extra work.
- Replace `range(10)` with your desired iterable length.
- Use lazy generators if the dataset is large to avoid holding all results in memory.
