DFS explores a branch as deep as possible before backtracking; BFS explores neighbors level by level using a queue.
```
**Explanation:** DFS uses a stack (explicit or recursion) to dive down paths, marking visited nodes to avoid cycles. BFS uses a queue to expand the frontier uniformly by distance from the start, visiting all nodes at depth d before depth d+1.
**Complexity:** Time: O(V + E) for both; Space: O(V) for visited plus O(V) recursion stack (DFS) or queue (BFS).
**Example:**
Input: graph = {0:[1,2], 1:[3], 2:[3], 3:[]}, start = 0
Output: DFS order [0,1,3,2]; BFS order [0,1,2,3]
**Notes:**
- BFS yields shortest paths in unweighted graphs; DFS does not guarantee shortest distances.
- Recursive DFS can overflow on very deep graphs; use an explicit stack if needed.
- Both require visited tracking on cyclic graphs to terminate.
