javascript
```javascript
reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, [1, 2, 3, 4], 0)
```
**Explanation:** Folds the array `[1,2,3,4]` with addition starting from 0, producing 10. `reduce` passes the accumulator and current element to the callback for each item.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1) auxiliary.
**Example:**
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 10
**Notes:**
- Without the initial `0`, the first element becomes the starting accumulator.
- Replace the callback to compute products, min/max, or other aggregates.
- On empty arrays, an initial value is required to avoid a TypeError.
