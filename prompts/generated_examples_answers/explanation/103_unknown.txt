Merge sort divides the array in half recursively, then merges the sorted halves into a single sorted array.
```
**Explanation:** Splitting continues until subarrays of size 1, which are inherently sorted. The merge step walks two sorted lists, repeatedly taking the smaller front element to build a sorted result. This guarantees stable, predictable performance regardless of input order.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n log n); Space: O(n) for merge buffers (plus O(log n) recursion stack).
**Example:**
Input: [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
**Notes:**
- Merge sort is stable; equal elements preserve order.
- For limited memory, use iterative bottom-up merges or in-place variants at higher complexity.
- Switch to insertion sort for tiny subarrays to improve constants.
