java
```java
list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))))
```
**Explanation:** This pseudocode filters the numbers 0..9 to keep even values, then maps each to its square, finally materializing the results in a list. In Java terms, it mirrors `IntStream.range(0,10).filter(x -> x % 2 == 0).map(x -> x * x).boxed().toList()`.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n) over the input range; Space: O(n) for the resulting list.
**Example:**
Input: numbers 0..9
Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
**Notes:**
- Order matters: filtering first avoids unnecessary squaring.
- Replace with streams or loops in real Java code; the given syntax is Pythonic.
- For lazy evaluation, keep as a stream rather than collecting immediately.
