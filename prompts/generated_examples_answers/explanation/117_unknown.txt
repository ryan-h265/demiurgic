Binary search halves the search interval each iteration when locating a target in a sorted collection.
```
**Explanation:** Repeatedly compare the middle element to the target; discard the lower or upper half accordingly. Stop when found or interval is empty. Requires sorted data for correctness.
**Complexity:** Time: O(log n); Space: O(1) for iterative form (O(log n) if recursive due to call stack).
**Example:**
Input: nums=[1,3,5,7], target=5
Output: index 2
**Notes:**
- For duplicates, adjust bounds to find first/last occurrence.
- Avoid overflow by computing mid as `lo + (hi - lo)/2` in languages with fixed-size ints.
- If data is unsorted, sort first (O(n log n)) or use hash-based lookup instead.
