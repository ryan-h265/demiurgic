python
```python
import requests

def fetch_json(url: str, timeout: float = 10.0) -> dict:
    resp = requests.get(url, timeout=timeout)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json()
```
**Explanation:** Issues an HTTP GET with a configurable timeout, raises on non-2xx responses, and parses the body as JSON, returning the decoded Python object.
**Complexity:** Time: O(response_size); Space: O(response_size) for the parsed JSON.
**Example:**
Input: fetch_json("https://api.github.com")
Output: Dict containing GitHub API metadata
**Notes:**
- Catch `requests.exceptions.RequestException` at call sites for retries/logging.
- For large bodies, stream and incrementally parse instead of loading fully.
- Ensure `requests` is installed in the environment.
