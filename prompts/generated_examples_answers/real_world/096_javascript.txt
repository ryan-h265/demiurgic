```javascript
import { Client } from 'pg';

export async function runQuery() {
  const client = new Client({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  });
  await client.connect();
  try {
    const res = await client.query('SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = $1', [true]);
    return res.rows;
  } finally {
    await client.end();
  }
}
```
**Explanation:** Uses `node-postgres` to connect with a connection string, executes a parameterized query, and returns the result rows. Ensures the client closes in a `finally` block.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n) over returned rows; Space: O(n) for loaded results.
**Example:**
Input: `await runQuery()`
Output: Array of active user records
**Notes:**
- Install dependency: `npm install pg`.
- Prefer pooled clients (`Pool`) for repeated queries.
- Handle errors with try/catch around the call site for logging or retries.
