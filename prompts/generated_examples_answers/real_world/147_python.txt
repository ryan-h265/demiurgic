```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def run_task():
    try:
        result = risky_operation()
        logger.info("Success: %s", result)
        return result
    except Exception as exc:  # catch specific exceptions in real code
        logger.exception("Task failed")
        # optionally retry or re-raise
        raise
    finally:
        logger.debug("Cleanup done")
```
**Explanation:** Wraps work in try/except/finally, logging successes, failures, and cleanup. Exceptions are logged with stack traces and re-raised to propagate failure.
**Complexity:** Time/Space overhead: O(1) around the wrapped call.
**Example:**
Input: call `run_task()` when `risky_operation` raises ValueError
Output: Logs stack trace via logger and re-raises the error
**Notes:**
- Replace broad `Exception` with specific ones to avoid masking bugs.
- Use retries/backoff around transient failures if appropriate.
- Configure logging handlers/levels elsewhere (e.g., basicConfig).
