```javascript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import fs from 'fs';

export async function uploadWithRetry(url, filePath, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const stream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
      const resp = await fetch(url, { method: 'POST', body: stream });
      if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${resp.status}`);
      return await resp.text();
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw err;
      await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200 * 2 ** attempt));
    }
  }
}
```
**Explanation:** Streams a file to an HTTP endpoint with exponential backoff on failure. Retries a limited number of times, returning the response text on success or rethrowing after exhaustion.
**Complexity:** Time: O(retries * upload_time); Space: O(chunk_size) buffered by streams.
**Example:**
Input: `await uploadWithRetry('https://example.com/upload', 'video.mp4')`
Output: server response body
**Notes:**
- Install `node-fetch`; ensure file path is valid.
- Add content-type headers if required by the server.
- For large uploads, consider resumable protocols; this does full retries.
