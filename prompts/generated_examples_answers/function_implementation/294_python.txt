from typing import Callable

def stream_file(path: str, chunk_size: int = 8192, handler: Callable[[bytes], None] = lambda _: None) -> None:
    try:
        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            while True:
                chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                handler(chunk)
    except OSError as exc:
        raise RuntimeError(f"failed to stream {path}: {exc}")
```
**Explanation:** Opens the file in binary mode and reads it in fixed-size chunks, invoking a handler for each chunk. Wraps I/O errors in a RuntimeError to surface failures cleanly.
**Complexity:** Time: O(file_size); Space: O(chunk_size).
**Example:**
Input: stream_file("big.bin", 1024, lambda c: print(len(c)))
Output: Prints sizes of each 1KB chunk until EOF
**Notes:**
- Customize `handler` for processing (hashing, uploading, etc.).
- Tune `chunk_size` for performance vs. memory.
- Caller can catch the RuntimeError to retry or report errors.
