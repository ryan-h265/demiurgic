/**
 * Aggregate a numeric matrix by summing each row and returning the grand total.
 */
function aggregateMatrix(matrix) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const row of matrix) {
    for (const val of row) {
      const num = Number(val);
      if (Number.isNaN(num)) throw new Error('Non-numeric value in matrix');
      total += num;
    }
  }
  return total;
}
```
**Explanation:** Iterates through every row and element, coerces to numbers, and accumulates a running sum. Throws if any value is non-numeric to keep results predictable.
**Complexity:** Time: O(r * c); Space: O(1) extra.
**Example:**
Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
Output: 10
**Notes:**
- Adapt to return row/column sums by collecting into arrays instead of a single total.
- For sparse matrices, iterate only non-zero entries to reduce work.
- Validate rectangular shape if downstream code assumes consistent column counts.
