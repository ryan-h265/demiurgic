c++
```cpp
#include <string>

// Aggregate: count characters and return length of the string.
int aggregateString(const std::string& s) {
    return static_cast<int>(s.size());
}
```
**Explanation:** Treats aggregation as computing the length of the input string; returns the number of characters.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: "hello"
Output: 5
**Notes:**
- Adjust aggregation to sum digits, count words, or other metrics as needed.
- For UTF-8 length in code points, iterate with a decoder instead of `size()`.
