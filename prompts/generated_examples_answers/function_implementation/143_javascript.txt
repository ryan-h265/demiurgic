```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { pipeline } from 'stream/promises';

// Stream a file to a writable destination without loading it all into memory
export async function streamFile(srcPath, destPath) {
  const src = fs.createReadStream(srcPath);
  const dest = fs.createWriteStream(destPath);
  await pipeline(src, dest);
}
```
**Explanation:** Uses Node's `pipeline` to pipe a readable stream to a writable stream with built-in backpressure and error propagation, preventing full file buffering.
**Complexity:** Time: O(file_size); Space: O(chunk_size) buffered by the streams.
**Example:**
Input: streamFile('big.bin', 'copy.bin')
Output: Copies data from source to destination
**Notes:**
- Handle errors with try/catch around `streamFile` calls.
- Tune `highWaterMark` on the streams for performance needs.
- Use `fs.createReadStream` with `start`/`end` for ranged streaming if needed.
