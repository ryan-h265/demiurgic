rust
```rust
pub fn aggregate_string(s: &str) -> usize {
    s.chars().count()
}
```
**Explanation:** Aggregates a string by returning its character count (Unicode scalar values).
**Complexity:** Time: O(n) over characters; Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: "hello"
Output: 5
**Notes:**
- Use `s.len()` for byte length instead.
- Adjust to aggregate differently (e.g., count words or digits) as needed.
- Counting grapheme clusters requires a more advanced iterator (e.g., unicode-segmentation crate).
