```python
import time
import requests
from typing import Callable, Any


def retry_with_backoff(func: Callable[[], Any], retries: int = 3, base_delay: float = 0.5) -> Any:
    """Call func with exponential backoff on exceptions."""
    attempt = 0
    while True:
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception as exc:
            attempt += 1
            if attempt > retries:
                raise
            delay = base_delay * (2 ** (attempt - 1))
            time.sleep(delay)
```
**Explanation:** Wraps a callable in a retry loop. On failure, waits with exponential backoff before retrying, raising the exception after exceeding the retry limit.
**Complexity:** Time: O(retries * work); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: `retry_with_backoff(lambda: requests.get(url, timeout=5).raise_for_status())`
Output: Returns the response if a retry succeeds; otherwise raises the last exception
**Notes:**
- Adjust `retries`/`base_delay` and add jitter to avoid thundering herds.
- Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `requests.exceptions.RequestException`) instead of blanket `Exception` in production.
- If func is stateful, ensure it is safe to retry.
