```rust
pub fn sum_matrix(mat: &[Vec<i32>]) -> i32 {
    let mut total = 0;
    for row in mat {
        for &v in row {
            total += v;
        }
    }
    total
}
```
**Explanation:** Iterates through each row and element, accumulating a running total of all entries in the matrix.
**Complexity:** Time: O(r * c); Space: O(1) extra.
**Example:**
Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 10
**Notes:**
- Replace the aggregation with min/max/average as needed.
- Handle empty matrices naturally; result stays 0.
- For large matrices, consider parallel iteration (e.g., Rayon) if performance is critical.
