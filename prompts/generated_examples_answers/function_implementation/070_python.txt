```python
from typing import Iterable, Union, List

Nested = Union[int, Iterable['Nested']]

def flatten(nested: Nested) -> List[int]:
    out: List[int] = []
    def dfs(item: Nested) -> None:
        if isinstance(item, Iterable) and not isinstance(item, (str, bytes)):
            for val in item:
                dfs(val)
        else:
            out.append(int(item))
    dfs(nested)
    return out
```
**Explanation:** Recursively traverses arbitrarily nested iterables, skipping string/bytes as atomic, and appends leaf elements to an output list, converting to int for uniformity.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n) elements; Space: O(n) for output plus recursion depth.
**Example:**
Input: [1, [2, [3, 4]], 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
**Notes:**
- For very deep nesting, switch to an explicit stack to avoid recursion depth errors.
- Remove `int()` cast if non-integer leaves should be preserved.
- Treat strings differently if you want to iterate characters instead of keeping whole string.
