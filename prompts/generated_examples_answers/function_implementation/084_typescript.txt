typescript
```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { ReadStream } from 'fs';

// Stream a file in chunks, invoking a handler per chunk with error handling.
export function streamFile(path: string, onChunk: (chunk: Buffer) => void): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const stream: ReadStream = fs.createReadStream(path);
    stream.on('data', onChunk);
    stream.on('error', reject);
    stream.on('end', resolve);
  });
}
```
**Explanation:** Uses Node’s `createReadStream` to read the file incrementally. Attaches listeners for data, error, and end events, exposing a promise that resolves when streaming finishes or rejects on errors.
**Complexity:** Time: O(file_size); Space: O(chunk_size) buffered by the stream.
**Example:**
Input: `await streamFile('large.log', (c) => console.log(c.length))`
Output: Logs chunk sizes until EOF
**Notes:**
- Pass `highWaterMark` in `createReadStream` options to tune chunk size.
- Ensure the handler is fast; otherwise, pause/resume the stream to apply backpressure.
- Wrap in try/catch when awaiting to surface errors.
