python
```python
from collections import Counter

def aggregate_string(s: str) -> dict[str, int]:
    """Count character frequencies in the string."""
    return dict(Counter(s))
```
**Explanation:** Uses `Counter` to tally occurrences of each character, returning a plain dict mapping characters to counts.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(k) for k distinct characters.
**Example:**
Input: "banana"
Output: {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}
**Notes:**
- Normalize case or strip whitespace before counting if desired.
- For word-level aggregation, split on whitespace instead of iterating characters.
- Counter supports addition/subtraction if merging multiple strings.
