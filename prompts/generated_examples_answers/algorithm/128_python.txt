```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


def has_cycle(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:
            return True
    return False
```
**Explanation:** Uses Floyd’s tortoise-hare pointers; if `fast` ever laps `slow`, a cycle exists. Terminating when `fast` or `fast.next` is null implies no cycle.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 (cycle)
Output: True
**Notes:**
- Handles empty/one-node lists safely.
- To locate the cycle entry, reset one pointer to head after detection and step both until they meet.
- Does not modify the list.
