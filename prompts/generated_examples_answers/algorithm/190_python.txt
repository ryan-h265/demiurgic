```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def k_way_merge(lists: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Merge k sorted lists into one sorted list using a min-heap."""
    heap = []
    result: List[int] = []
    for i, arr in enumerate(lists):
        if arr:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (arr[0], i, 0))
    while heap:
        val, li, idx = heapq.heappop(heap)
        result.append(val)
        nxt = idx + 1
        if nxt < len(lists[li]):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[li][nxt], li, nxt))
    return result
```
**Explanation:** Initializes a min-heap with the first element of each list and repeatedly pops the smallest, pushing the next element from that list. This maintains the overall sorted order across all lists.
**Complexity:** Time: O(N log k) where N is total elements and k is number of lists; Space: O(k) for the heap plus output.
**Example:**
Input: [[1,4],[2,3],[0,5]]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
**Notes:**
- Handles empty lists gracefully.
- For custom ordering, store comparator keys accordingly.
- Keep tuples small to minimize heap overhead.
