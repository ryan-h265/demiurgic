python
```python
def print_array(arr):
    if arr is None:
        return
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        print(arr[i])
```
**Explanation:** The original loop used `<= arr.length`, causing an out-of-bounds access. Here we iterate with `range(len(arr))`, which stops before the end index, and guard against `None` input.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: [1, 2]
Output: prints 1 then 2
**Notes:**
- Works safely for empty arrays (no output).
- Use logging instead of print for production environments.
- For huge arrays, consider batching output to avoid overwhelming stdout.
