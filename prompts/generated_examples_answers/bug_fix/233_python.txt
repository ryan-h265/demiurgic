```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


def has_cycle(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:
            return True
    return False
```
**Explanation:** Replaces unsafe `head.next.next` traversal with Floyd’s cycle detection that checks `fast` and `fast.next` before advancing two steps. Returns a boolean indicating presence of a cycle, covering empty or single-node lists safely.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2
Output: True
**Notes:**
- Handles n=0 without throwing.
- To find the cycle start, reset one pointer to head after detection and move both one step at a time.
- Leaves the list unmodified.
