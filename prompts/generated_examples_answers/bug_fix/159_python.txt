```python
def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:
            return True
    return False
```
**Explanation:** Guards null pointers by checking `fast` and `fast.next` before advancing two steps, preventing out-of-bounds when the list is empty (`n=0`) or of length 1. Uses Floyd's algorithm to detect cycles.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: head=None
Output: False
**Notes:**
- Works for all list sizes without throwing.
- To find cycle entry, apply the standard two-phase approach after detection.
- Leaves list structure unchanged.
