```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


def has_cycle_safe(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:
            return True
    return False
```
**Explanation:** Replaces the unsafe pointer jumping with Floyd's cycle detection, advancing `fast` two steps only when `fast` and `fast.next` are non-null to avoid out-of-bounds.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> (back to 2)
Output: True
**Notes:**
- Works for empty and single-node lists without throwing.
- If you just need to check for null next, guard before `next.next` access as shown.
- To find the cycle start, reset one pointer to head after detection and advance both one step at a time.
