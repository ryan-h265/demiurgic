```javascript
function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
**Explanation:** The original loop dereferenced `head.next.next` without null checks. This uses Floyd's cycle detection with guards on `fast` and `fast.next` to avoid null-pointer errors while safely detecting cycles.
**Complexity:** Time: O(n); Space: O(1).
**Example:**
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 (cycle)
Output: true
**Notes:**
- Works for empty or single-node lists (returns false).
- To find cycle entry, reset one pointer to head after detection and move both one step at a time.
- Does not modify the list structure.
