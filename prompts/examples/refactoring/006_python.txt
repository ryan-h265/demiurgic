============================================================

Refactor this Python code to be more idiomatic:
```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        total = total + numbers[i]
    return total

my_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
sum_result = calculate_sum(my_numbers)
```
